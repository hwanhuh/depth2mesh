This project contrains 'Textured Mesh Generator from Depth Map' where the depth map is generated by [Marigold depth generation](https://marigoldmonodepth.github.io/). 
It takes an input image and a corresponding depth map, which is generated those Marigold. 

### Features

- **Image Input**: Accepts standard image formats like JPG, JPEG, and PNG.
- **Depth Map**: npy file whose generated by marigold (or GT depth map converted to numpy array is OK).


- **Textured Mesh Output**: Produces a textured mesh that combines the visual information from the image with the structural details from the depth map.

Usage
Provide an image and its corresponding depth map.
Run the processing script to generate the textured mesh.
Visualize or further process the output mesh using 3D software or frameworks.

```bash
    python depth_to_textured_mesh.py --depth <path to depth map npy file> --image <path to input image file>
```
